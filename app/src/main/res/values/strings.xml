        <item>Sorts an array by swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order</item>

    <string-array name="insertion">
        <item>A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time</item>
        <item>Starting with the second item in the array for as long as the number to the left is less than the current number swap current number with the number on its left</item>

    <string-array name="merge">
        <item>Sorts an array by swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order</item>
        <item>The algorithm starts by splitting the array half then split those halves in half until there is until each subarray is size one</item>
        <item>Each pair of halves is sorted then sorts as they merge with each other</item>
        <item>This method can be looked at as similar to divide and conquer but they sort as they conquer</item>

        <item>Remove or ignore that node as part of the heap because it has just been sorted</item>
        <item>Since the array is already in a heap, repeat the rest of the steps to sorted the rest of the nodes in the heap or the rest of the elements in the array</item>

        <item></item>

        <item>Iterates through array to find a lower value then the minimum value and swaps it with the old minimum value making it the new minimum value</item>
        <item>Each preceding item in the array will be sorted starting from the front after each iteration</item>
